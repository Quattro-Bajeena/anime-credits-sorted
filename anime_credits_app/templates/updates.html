    <p>This is WIP page for posting news about new features added to the page and bugs I'm currently fighting. Eventually I'd like to make it nice and clean, but for now this has to do.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>06.07.21</em>:[NEW] AGH updating is fucked. WHAT IS HAPPENING?! I'm too tired for this shit.</li>
        <li><em>06.07.21</em>: yee, I fixed it. I'll get a go at fleshing out studio staticts, rankings etc.</li>
        <li><em>06.07.21</em>: Currently wherever page tries to update a person that already exists, when it comes to their manga I get database error, I have no idea why. When I downloaded new creator page it was goo. So that's why there are those few failed downloads you an see. </li>
    </ul>
